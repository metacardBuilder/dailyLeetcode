'''
Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of lowercase English letters.

        n, ans = len(s), 0
        
        def palindromeCount(left: int, right: int) -> int:
            count = 0
            while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:
                left -= 1
                right += 1
                count += 1
            return count
        
        for i in range(n):
            even = palindromeCount(i, i + 1)
            odd = palindromeCount(i, i)
            ans += even + odd
            
        return ans
